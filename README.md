# Multiplication table learning web application

This web application was developed so that my children can learn and practice the multiplication table in a fun way, and see that it is possible to program interesting and nice things as well :smiley:

It allows users to register, login, logout, and solve exercises to learn the entire 10x10 multiplication table.

You can find it on: https://learnmultiplicationtable.herokuapp.com/

I hope any child or adult who wants to practice the multiplication table will find it useful.


Enjoy practicing!
