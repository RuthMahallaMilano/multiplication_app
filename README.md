# Learning Multiplication Table app

This app was developed so that my children can learn and practice the multiplication table in a fun way, and see that it is possible to program interesting and nice things as well :smiley:

I hope any child or adult who wants to practice the multiplication table will find it useful.

I used flask as web-framework and flask-SQLalchemy for database managing.
The app is deployed to Heroku.

Enjoy practicing!
